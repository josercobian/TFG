## Performance of metrics in the dataset

This experiment consists of drawing conclusions about the dataset of José Ramón
Cobián. This dataset contains exactly the Boolean functions from five bits to
one bit which can be computed by circuits of 10 or less NAND gates. We will compare
this dataset with a large sample of 5-bit Boolean functions randomly selected, and see
if it is possible to predict whether they will belong to this dataset or not (i.e., whether
they can be computed by particularly small circuits). We are interested in obtaining
percentiles that completely separate both sets, as these percentiles could provide us with
more information about the aforementioned lower bound sought earlier.
