## Scalability of metrics

In this experiment, we want to observe the scalability of the metrics.This experiment 
consists of taking a small sample of N-bit Boolean functions, which are unlikely 
to belong to P/poly, in order to observe the values of the metrics they possess. Moreover, with 
this experiment, a more detailed comparison could be provided regarding where the decision problems 
of interest are encountered.
