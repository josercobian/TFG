# TFG (inf)

This repository showcases the files and code related to my Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Science, which I had the privilege of
working on in collaboration with Enrique Carro Garrido. The project aims to tackle the P vs NP problem through P_{/poly} by identifying
properties that may indicate the necessity of every circuit computing a Boolean function to be superpolynomial in size.

The first two folders contain the implementation in C++ of the metrics that quantify these properties. Then, the folder 
"Experiments" contains the experiments that were conducted in C++ and subsequently analyzed using Python. Lastly, we have the report 
where we provide a detailed explanation of these properties, their significance, and thoroughly analyze the obtained results.
